# Shared definition block
# This is where you would define any attributes that all your jobs will 
# inherit. In our example, we state that all our Jobs will use the same Docker
# container for building in, as well as have a common environment variable set
shared:
  # Docker image to use as the desired build container. This typically takes the
  # form of "repo_name". Alternatively, you can define the image as 
  # "repo_name:tag_label"
  # Docker image reference - https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/
  image: golang
  # A map of environment variables that we want to set
  environment:
    # We set the GOPATH to the build workspace. Eventually, this will be
    # accessible by another environment variable that we can reference instead
    # of hard-coding it here
    GOPATH: /sd/workspace

# Jobs definition block
# All pipelines have "main" by default, and is implicitly defined.
jobs:
  # We explicitly define "main" in our configuration so that it does what we 
  # want it to do.
  main:
    requires: 
      - ~pr
      - ~commit
    # Steps is the ordered list of commands to execute.
    # Each step takes the form "step_name: command_to_run". The "step_name" is a
    # convient label to reference it by. The "command_to_run" is the single 
    # command that is executed during the step.
    steps:
      # Go commands document - https://golang.org/cmd/go/
      
      # This step downloads and installs packages and dependencies
      - get: go get -t ./...
      # The "vet" step runs the go tool vet on packages
      - vet: go vet ./...
      # This step runs gofmt on package resources
      - gofmt: "find . -name '*.go' | xargs gofmt -s -w"
      # The "test" step tests the packages
      - test: go test ./...
      # Compiles the packages and dependencies
      - build: go build -o hello_go -a ./...
